    "Implement a function called `steer()`, which takes as inputs two **states** `x1` and `x2` and returns a control input (steering angle) that \"tries\" to make progress from `x1` to `x2`. This method should consist roughly of the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Get a sense of where `x2` is relative to the state of `x1` by calculating the orientation difference between the current orientation, $\\theta$, and the direction toward `x2`.\n",
    "2. Generate a random steering angle by sampling from a gaussian that is centered roughly on some direction that will move you from `x1` to `x2`.\n",
    "3. Clip the angle if it is outside the range allowed by `MAX_STEERING_ANGLE`.\n",
    "\n",
    "This might all sound a little fuzzy, but that's the idea here! We're just going to try some guessing and see if we can find a simple method for making progress from `x1` to `x2`.  \n",
    "\n",
    "**Inconsistency note:** Point 1 of the guidance above suggests a _dynamic_ solution. That is, as the car moves away from `x1`, the direction to `x2` should be calculated from the _current position_, not `x1`. In this sense, `x1` is the start state and is only \"current\" in the very first moment. However, the usage of `steer` in the following code does not predicate this dynamic solution. Instead, the angles for each step are precomputed with `x1` and `x2` fixed. The variation is only going to be due to the Gaussian.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Resolution note:** The visualization in the solution is only showing the first T steps for the trajectory maintaining one of the precomputed randomized steering angles. The point is to show the variation of the local trajectories at the current position, but it is only being visualized for the start state. So, `steer` should definitely use the current state to calculate the next steering angle and be called before `simulate`. This visualization of the full trajectory from `x1` to `x2` should be done separately."
