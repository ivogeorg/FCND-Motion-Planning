# FCND Project 2: Motion Planning

Planning in the complex urban environment of San Francisco using the `udacidrone` API and the Unity-based Udacity simulator. A [guide](project-and-submission-guide.md) describes the project setup and the submission requirements. The code-writing **TODOs**, both required and optional, are all inlined in [motion_planning.py](motion_planning.py).

## Starter Code

The overall architecture of this project is (i) user code contained in a sublclass of `udacidrone.Drone` class, (ii) the `udacidrone` API serving as an interface between high-level user code and the simulator, mediated over a two-way MAVLink message stream, and (iii) the Unity-based simulator that contains the urban world and the low-level dynamics and control of the drone.
