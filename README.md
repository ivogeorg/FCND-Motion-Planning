# FCND Project 2: Motion Planning

Planning in the complex urban environment of San Francisco using the `udacidrone` API and the Unity-based Udacity simulator. A [guide](project-and-submission-guide.md) describes the project setup and the submission requirements. The code-writing **TODOs**, both required and optional, are consolidated in [motion_planning.py](motion_planning.py).
